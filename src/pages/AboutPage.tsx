        <h1>Local Find</h1>
        <p>We are local food hunt apps that recommend authentic local street vendors/food 
          trucks/small restaurants to the users. This project aims to increase local food owners' 
          brand visibility to the customers as the leading food reviews website often shows franchises 
          and high end popular restaurants. Therefore, the function of this project includes search functions 
          for different types of foods where multiple tags are used to narrow down relevant local vendors. The apps also 
          include built-in maps where customers can locate their destination and receive restaurant recommendations along 
          their commute.</p>
